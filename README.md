# TS-Models

This repository contains a series of exercises designed to deepen the understanding of **Time Series Models**.  
The work is part of coursework and independent exploration, and is intended **only for educational purposes**.

Each file corresponds to a specific modeling approach, dataset, or concept related to time series analysis.
